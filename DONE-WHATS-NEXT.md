## 🆘 Need Help?

### Common Questions:

**Q: I don't know how to code. Can I still do this?**
A: YES! All the coding is done. You just need to:
   - Copy photos to a folder
   - Write your stories in plain text
   - Change a few filenames

A: Follow the GitHub deployment steps in START-HERE.md
   It's free and takes 15 minutes

**Q: What if I can't finish in 4 days?**

   Even if rushed, it's better to have something personal than nothing.

   Focus on the content first!

**Q: What password should I use?**
A: Something meaningful to both of you:
   - Your anniversary date: "Aug262025"
   - An inside joke
   - A special phrase
