// INSTRUCTIONS FOR WRITING LOVE LETTERS:
// ===================================

/*

1. MAKE THEM PERSONAL:
   - These shouldn't be generic quotes you found online
   - Write things that are TRUE and SPECIFIC to your relationship
   - Mention actual things she does that you love

2. KEEP THEM SHORT:
   - 1-3 sentences is perfect
   - They should be easy to read quickly
   - Think of them as little love notes, not essays

3. VARIETY:
   - Some should be about specific things she does
   - Some should be about how she makes you feel
   - Some should be about your relationship
   - Some should be playful, some serious
   - Some should be about the future

4. EXAMPLES OF GOOD LOVE LETTERS:

   Generic (DON'T do this):
   "You're beautiful and I love you."

   Personal (DO this):
   "I love the way you scrunch your nose when you laugh at your own jokes. It's the cutest thing I've ever seen."

   Generic (DON'T do this):
   "You're the best girlfriend ever."

   Personal (DO this):
   "Remember when you stayed up with me until 3am just because I couldn't sleep? That's when I knew you were special."

5. IDEAS FOR WHAT TO WRITE:
   - Specific things she does that you love
   - Moments when you realized how much you care about her
   - Inside jokes between you two
   - Things you're excited to do together
   - What makes her different from everyone else
   - How she makes you feel
   - Specific memories that stand out
   - Things you admire about her personality
   - Plans you have for the future together
   - Why you're grateful for her

6. REPLACE THE BRACKETED PARTS:
   - Letter #7 says "[INSERT SOMETHING SPECIFIC SHE DOES]"
   - Replace that with actual things! For example:
     "I love how you always text me good morning, even before you've had your coffee."
     "I love how you dance when you cook, even though you say you can't dance."
     "I love how you get so excited about little things, it reminds me to appreciate life more."

7. ADD MORE IF YOU WANT:
   - Feel free to add more than 15!
   - The more you add, the more variety she'll see
   - Just follow the same format: "Your message here",

8. USE "YOU" NOT "HER":
   - Write like you're talking to her directly
   - "You make me smile" not "She makes me smile"

Now go back up and replace those placeholder letters with YOUR words! 💕

REMEMBER:
- Be genuine, not flowery
- Be specific, not generic
- Be you, not what you think sounds romantic
- Write from the heart
