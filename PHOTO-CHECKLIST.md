## Tips

### For Photos:
- Include a mix: romantic, funny, candid, posed
- Show variety: different locations, outfits, seasons
- Quality over quantity: Better to have 40 great photos than 60 mediocre ones
- Include moments that tell your story

### For Writing:
- Be specific (mention actual moments, inside jokes)
- Be genuine (write from the heart, not what sounds good)
- Include sensory details (what you saw, felt, heard)
- Keep it personal (things only she would understand)

### For Music:
- Choose a song that won't get old quickly
- Make sure it's appropriate for looping
- Consider instrumental if lyrics might be distracting
- Test volume levels (not too loud)
