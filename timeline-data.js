// ===================================
// INSTRUCTIONS FOR FILLING THIS OUT:
// ===================================

/*

1. WRITE YOUR STORIES:
   - Replace the [ADD YOUR STORY] parts with your actual memories
   - Be specific and detailed - mention actual places, conversations, feelings
   - Include sensory details (what you saw, heard, felt, smelled, tasted)
   - Mention inside jokes and personal moments only you two would understand
   - Be genuine and write from the heart

2. ADD YOUR PHOTOS:
   - Replace the photo filenames (e.g., "first-date-1.jpg") with the actual names of your photos
   - Make sure the photo names match exactly with the files in images/photos/
   - You can have as many or as few photos per event as you want
   - Example: photos: ["IMG_1234.jpg", "IMG_1235.jpg", "IMG_1236.jpg"]

3. TIPS FOR WRITING:
   - Don't be generic - "We had a great time" is boring
   - Be specific - "You laughed so hard at my joke that you snorted, and that made me fall for you even more"
   - Include emotions - "I was nervous but excited, and when you smiled at me, everything felt right"
   - Mention details - "You wore that blue dress that made your eyes sparkle"
   - Tell mini-stories - "Remember when we got lost trying to find that restaurant? We ended up..."

4. EXAMPLE OF A GOOD STORY:

   Instead of:
   "We went to a restaurant and had dinner. It was nice."

   Write:
   "We went to that Italian restaurant you'd been talking about for weeks. You ordered the carbonara
   and let me try a bite, and I remember thinking how cute you looked when you got so excited about
   the food. We talked for three hours straight about everything from our childhood dreams to our
   weirdest fears. I didn't want the night to end. When we walked to the car, you grabbed my hand
   for the first time, and I swear my heart skipped a beat."

5. MAKE IT PERSONAL:
   - Use "you" and "I" - talk directly to her
   - Reference specific moments only you two know about
   - Include her reactions, things she said, how she made you feel
   - Don't worry about perfect grammar - authenticity > perfection
